# Penetration-Testing-on-a-Virtual-Machine


## Objective
To demonstrate the practical application of ethical hacking and penetration testing techniques by simulating real-world cyberattacks in a controlled virtual environment. The project utilized Kali Linux as the attacker machine and Metasploitable as the target system to identify vulnerabilities, exploit security weaknesses, and document the exploitation lifecycle. This project highlights my skills in vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and secure environment configuration for cybersecurity practices.

### Skills Learned
- Virtualization Setup – Configured and managed multiple virtual machines (Kali Linux & Metasploitable) for penetration testing.

- Information Gathering – Used tools like nmap for network scanning and service enumeration.

- Vulnerability Assessment – Identified security loopholes in Metasploitable using Kali tools.

- Exploitation Techniques – Executed exploits using Metasploit Framework to gain access to vulnerable services.

- Post-Exploitation – Maintained access, extracted information, and understood persistence techniques.

- Linux Command-line Proficiency – Strengthened hands-on skills in navigating and managing Linux environments.

- Ethical Hacking Mindset – Learned how to simulate attacks responsibly in a controlled lab setup.

- Documentation & Reporting – Recorded penetration testing lifecycle, from reconnaissance to exploitation, for professional reporting.
### Tools Used
- Kali Linux – Attacker machine for penetration testing.

- Metasploitable – Intentionally vulnerable target machine.

- Zenmap (Nmap GUI) – Used for IP discovery, port scanning, and service enumeration.

- Metasploit Framework – Exploited discovered vulnerabilities and performed post-exploitation activities.

- VirtualBox / VMware – Virtualization platform to set up and run isolated lab environments.

## Steps

1.Target Discovery & Scanning

- Scanned the target machine’s IP address using Zenmap (Nmap GUI).

- Collected information about open ports and running services.

2.Launching Metasploit Console

- Opened msfconsole in Kali Linux to begin the exploitation phase.

3.Service & Version Identification

- Used Nmap scan results to identify the specific port and service version running on the target.

- Verified vulnerabilities associated with the discovered service version.

4.Exploit Search & Selection

- Searched for the corresponding exploit module in Metasploit Framework.

- Selected the appropriate exploit path for the vulnerable service.

5.Configuring Exploit Parameters

- Set the target machine’s IP address (RHOST) and other necessary parameters.

6.Exploitation Phase

- Executed the exploit using Metasploit.

- Successfully gained unauthorized access to the target system.
